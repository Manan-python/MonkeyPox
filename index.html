      <h1>MonkeyPox: The new coronovirus?</h1>
      <p class="heading-subtext">
        Monkeypox is a viral zoonosis (a virus transmitted to humans from
        animals) with symptoms similar to those seen in the past in smallpox
        patients, although it is clinically less severe. With the eradication
        of smallpox in 1980 and subsequent cessation of smallpox vaccination,
        monkeypox has emerged as the most important orthopoxvirus for public health.
        Monkeypox primarily occurs in central and west Africa, often in proximity
        to tropical rainforests, and has been increasingly appearing in urban areas.
        Animal hosts include a range of rodents and non-human primates.

      <h2>Map Of Monkeypox spread in the world</h2>
      <p>The map represents total Monkey pox cases around the world as recorded on
          15 September 2022. The disease which was usually not seen in urban areas
          has slowly found its way there, as is evdient with the rise of monkeypox
          cases in developed countries such as United States and Canada.
          You can also filter the map data based on a particular date by selecting
          any date on the bar graph below the map.

      <p>The MonkeyPox virus has been found to be spreading significantly within
        males as compared to females or other genders as is eveident from this
        donut chart which showcases almost 90% of the monkeypox cases are males.
      </p>
<p>
        There is another interesting statistic that liews within the males and
        females demographic. Approximately 9 out of 10 males who are infected with
        the MonkeyPox virus identify themselves as part of the LGBTQ+, whereas,
        with women only 2 out of 10 were identified as belonging to the LGBTQ+ community.

      <h2>Cases by Ethnicity</h2>
      <p>The graph showcases the percentages of cases by ethnicity over the weeks of May
        to September in 2022. Interestingly, the cases within the black and african
        community has been on a constant rise whereas the whit community has seen a gradual decline.
        The latino community has been pretty constant throughout the spread. Also, the percentage of
        Asian people affected has been quite low even though being the most populous continent.

    <h2>Symptoms reported</h2>
    <p>People with monkeypox get a rash that may be located on or near the genitals
      (penis, testicles, labia, and vagina) or anus (butthole) and could be on other
      areas like the hands, feet, chest, face, or mouth.

The rash will go through several stages, including scabs, before healing.
The rash can initially look like pimples or blisters and may be painful or itchy.
Other symptoms of monkeypox can include:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Chills</li>
<li>Swollen lymph nodes</li>
<li>Exhaustion</li>
<li>Muscle aches and backache</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Respiratory symptoms</li>
</ul></p>
<p>
Monkeypox is usually a self-limited disease with the symptoms lasting from 2 to 4 weeks.
Severe cases occur more commonly among children and are related to the extent of virus
exposure, patient health status and nature of complications. Underlying immune deficiencies
may lead to worse outcomes.
